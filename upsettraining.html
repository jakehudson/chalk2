		<h1>Upset Training</h1>
		<p>Chalk 2 offers unique upset and safety training designed for student pilots, general 
		aviation pilots as well as UAV pilots and flight test engineers.  The safety courses 
		have been developed with the goal to assist pilots of all skill-levels in becoming 
		safer and more confident through training and hands-on experience.  Are you looking 
		for something more customized or an aerobatic ride experience? We provide additional 
		options as well to meet your needs.</p>

		<h2>The Airplane:</h2>
		<p>The Extra 300L is a high performance certified aerobatic aircraft with a well-respected 
		safety record and provides the perfect platform for students and high-level competition 
		pilots alike.  Rated for +/- 10 G’s and offering 300 horsepower, the Extra 300L not only allows 
		pilots the ability to test the edges of the flight envelop in a safe environment but also gives 
		the experience flying one of the most high-performance aerobatic aircraft in the world.</p>

		<h3>Introduction to Spins and Safety (1-Day Course)</h3>
	
		<p>This is a one-day introduction to the basics of aviation safety through an academic 
		ground session followed by an instructional flight.  Geared towards general aviation 
		pilots and student pilots interested in getting their feet wet in the realm of aviation 
		safety training, this course not only reviews very basic aerodynamics, slow flight, 
		stalls and spins but also touches on the human factors issues that are highlighted 
		in case studies and videos used during the academic block of the training.</p>
		
		<p><ul>Training Aircraft: Extra 300L<br />
		Maximum Ground Instruction: 3.5 hours<br />
		Maximum Flight Time: 0.7 hours (1 flight)<p></ul>

		<h3>Basic Upset and Safety Training (2-Day Course)</h3>

		<p>This two-day safety course (2 Academic and Flight Blocks per day) allows the 
		general aviation pilot to safely explore the edges of the flight envelop while increasing 
		their awareness and ability to be the safest pilot they can be.  With a strong focus on human 
		factors and general aerodynamics, review of numerous case studies and allowing the student to 
		experiment with stalls, spins and upset recoveries, this course assists pilots in attaining a 
		deeper understanding of aviation safety while increasing their piloting skills and overall 
		confidence in the cockpit.</p>
		
		<p><ul>Training Aircraft: Extra 300L<br />
		Maximum Ground Instruction: 8 hours<br />
		Maximum Flight Time: 2.8 hours<p></ul>

		<h3>Advanced Safety and Introduction to Aerobatics Training (3 Day Course)</h3>
		
		<p>This three-day course (2 Academic and Flight Blocks per day) is designed to allow 
		pilots who have already completed the Basic Aviation Safety Training to continue into more 
		advanced spins and upsets as well as an introduction to aerobatic flying at the primary and/or 
		sportsman level (customer preference).</p> 
		
		<p><ul>Training Aircraft: Extra 300L<br />
		Maximum Ground Instruction: 12 hours<br />
		Maximum Flight Time: 4.2 hours (6 flights)<p></ul>

		<h3>Flight Safety Training for the UAV Pilot and Flight Test Engineer <i>(Under Development)</i></h3>
		
		<p>This safety course is being designed specifically with UAV instructors/flight test 
		engineers in mind.  This 3-day course (2 Academic and Flight Blocks per day) includes review of 
		issues particular to loss of control of UAV’s, high altitude upsets and human factors that play a 
		particular role in unmanned operations.   Through multiple academic sessions and Extra 300L training 
		flights, students are able to safely explore the flight envelop as well as gain a deeper understanding 
		of the testing that goes into the development of new UAV platforms. Additionally for FAA certificated pilots, 
		this course will increase stick and rudder skills and pilot confidence. </p>
